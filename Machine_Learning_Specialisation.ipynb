        "- A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\n",
        "- The more opportunities an algorithm is given to learn, the better the algorithm performs.\n",
        "- Types of Machine Learning Algorithms - Supervised, Unsupervised, Recommender Systems and Reinforcement Learning.\n",
        "- Supervised learning is used most in real-world applications and has seen rapid enhancements.\n",

        "**Supervised Learning:**\n",
        "- Refers to algorithms that learn input (x) to (y).\n",
        "- Algorithms are given examples of x-y pairs to learn how to predict the correct y for the given x.\n",
        "- Types of Supervised Learning:\n",
        "  - Regression: Predicting a number output from infinitely many possible number outputs.\n",
        "  - Classification: Predicting classes/categories which could be numeric or non-numeric from finitely many possible classes/categories.\n",

        "**Unsupervised Learning:**\n",
        "- In supervised learning, the outputs are labelled, whereas, in unsupervised learning, the outputs are not labelled.\n",
        "- In supervised learning, there are inputs and the outputs are labelled. In unsupervised learning, there are inputs and the outputs are unlabelled.\n",
        "- Unsupervised learning aims to find a pattern in the unlabelled data.\n",
        "- Tyles of Unsupervised Learning:\n",
        "  - Clustering: Groups similar unlabelled data together into clusters.\n",
        "  - Anomaly Detection: Finds unusual unlabelled data.\n",
        "  - Dimensionality Reduction: Takes a bigger dataset and compressing it into a smaller dataset while loosing as little information as possible.\n",
